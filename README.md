# Text_Classification_BERT
##BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a powerful pre-trained model for natural language processing tasks, and it can be used for text classification, including spam detection.
#Steps

Here are the general steps to use BERT for spam and ham classification:

1. Data Preparation:

Prepare a labeled dataset of spam and ham messages.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

2. Preprocessing:

Tokenize your text data using the BERT tokenizer.
Convert the tokens to BERT input format (input IDs, attention masks, and segment IDs).

3. Model Fine-Tuning:

Load a pre-trained BERT model (e.g., from the Hugging Face Transformers library).
Add a classification head to the BERT model for binary classification (spam or ham).
Fine-tune the model on your training data. You'll need to define a loss function and optimize it using gradient descent.

4. Evaluation:

Evaluate the fine-tuned model on your testing dataset to assess its performance.

5. Inference:

Use the trained BERT model for classifying new messages as spam or ham.
